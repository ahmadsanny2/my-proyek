                    <p class=""><strong>Elsa Savitrie, SKM, M.Kes - RSUP dr. Mohammad Hoesin Palembang
                        </strong>
                    <p>You've got a mental...</p>
                    These words are often heard by teenagers today, to bully or
                    weaken the person they are talking to. However, this seems to have become a trend among
                    teenagers now.

                    Mental health is influenced by events in life that leave a major impact on a person's
                    personality and behavior. These events may include domestic violence, child abuse, or long-term
                    severe stress.

                    If mental health is disturbed, mental disorders or mental illness arise. Mental disorders can
                    change the way a person handles stress, relates to others, makes choices, and triggers desires
                    to harm themselves.

                        Understanding Mental Health
                    </h3>
                    <P>Mental health is a condition where an individual has well-being that is visible from him being
                        able to realize his own potential, having the ability to overcome normal life pressures in
                        various situations in life, being able to work productively and productively, and being able to
                        contribute to his community.

                    <P><strong>Symptoms of Mental Disorders</strong></P>

                    The following are some symptoms or signs of mental illness that may occur in children:</P>
                    <p></p>
                    <ol>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Behavior change</li>
                        </strong>
                        This is a sign of mental illness in children which is relatively easy for you to notice through
                        daily activities both at home and at school. When children fight more often, tend to be rude,
                        and even say rude things that hurt other people even though they didn't before, you need to be
                        suspicious. Not only that, you may also see changes in your child's behavior, such as becoming
                        more irritable and feeling frustrated.
                        <strong>
                            <li>Mood changes</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Another sign of mental illness is a child's sudden change in mood. This condition can last
                            for a short time or for an uncertain period of time.

                            Of course, this can cause problems in relationships with family and peers. This is a common
                            symptom of depression, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.</p>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Children who suffer from mental disorders tend to have difficulty focusing or paying
                            attention for long periods of time. Apart from that, they also have difficulty sitting still
                            and reading. This sign of mental illness can cause decreased performance at school as well
                            as brain development.</p>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Weight loss</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Did you know that mental disorders can also affect a child's physical condition? Not only due
                            to physical illness, drastic weight loss can also be a sign of a child's mental illness.
                            Eating disorders, stress, and even depression can cause children to lose their appetite,
                            persistent nausea and vomiting.</p>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Hurt yourself</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Pay attention to when your child often experiences excessive worry and fear. These feelings
                            can lead to the desire to hurt yourself.

                            Usually, this is an accumulation of feelings of stress and self-blame because mental
                            disorders also make it difficult for children to manage their emotions. This is also a sign
                            of mental disorders in children that you need to pay attention to because it does not rule
                            out the possibility of leading to a suicide attempt.</p>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Various health problems arise</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Mental illnesses or disorders can also be characterized by health problems, for example
                            children experience ongoing headaches and stomach aches.</p>
                        <strong>
                            <li>Intense feelings</li>
                        </strong>
                        <p>Children sometimes experience excessive feelings of fear for no reason. Signs of mental
                            disorders in children include crying, screaming or nausea accompanied by very intense
                            feelings. This feeling can also cause effects such as difficulty breathing, heart
                            palpitations or rapid breathing, which can interfere with daily activities.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Characteristics of Good Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>Adolescents with good mental health often have the following characteristics:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Feel happier and more positive about themselves and enjoy life</li>
                        <li>Bounce back from annoyance and disappointment</li>
                        <li>Have healthier relationships with family and friends</li>
                        <li>Do physical activity and eat healthy food</li>
                        <li>Get involved in activities</li>
                        <li>Have a sense of accomplishment</li>
                        <li>Can relax and sleep soundly</li>
                        <li>Feel comfortable in their community</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Promoting Mental Health for Adolescents</p>
                    <p>Love and support as well as strong relationships with family and those closest to them can have a
                        direct and positive influence on mental health for teenagers. In fact, good emotional
                        relationships can reduce the chances of teenagers experiencing mental health problems

                        Mental health promotion aims to promote positive mental health. The way this can be done is by
                        increasing psychological well-being, competence, human resilience, as well as creating
                        supportive living conditions and environments (WHO, 2002). Promotion of mental health can be
                        done by collecting data related to the incidence of these disorders so that people increase
                        their awareness and gain knowledge regarding problems.</p>
                    <p>Here are some ways to promote mental health for teenagers and improve their well-being:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Show love, affection, and concern for your teenager.</li>
                        <li>Show that you are interested in what is going on in your child's life. Praise children's
                            efforts as well as their good points and achievements. Respect your child's ideas and
                            opinions.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy spending time with your child, and also as a family.</li>
                        <li>Encourage your child to talk about his feelings with you. It is important for children to
                            feel that they do not have to go through everything alone and that you can work together to
                            find solutions to problems.</li>
                        <li>Address problems immediately as they arise, rather than letting them build up.</li>
                        <li>Talk to a trusted family member, friend, parent or other teacher if you have concerns. If
                            you feel you need more help, talk to your GP or other health professional about your child's
                            mental condition.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Physical health is a big part of mental health. To help your child stay emotionally and
                        physically healthy, encourage your child to do the following:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Stay active. Physical fitness will help children stay healthy, have more energy, feel
                            confident, manage stress and sleep well.</li>
                        <li>Develop and maintain healthy eating habits.</li>
                        <li>Get enough regular sleep. Quality sleep will help children to manage busy lives, stress and
                            responsibilities.</li>
                        <li>Avoid alcohol and other drugs.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Efforts to Maintain Mental Health for Adolescents</p>
                    <p>Talking heart to heart with your teenager about his condition and mental health is the first step
                        you need to take as a parent. If you are concerned about your child's mental health, start by
                        talking to him. Talking to your child about how they are feeling shows that they are not alone
                        and that you, as the parent, care. Apart from that, your child may also need your help to get
                        professional support.</p>
                    <p>Here are some ideas for encouraging your teen to talk to you about their feelings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Say that even adults have problems that they cannot solve on their own. Point out that it's
                            easier to get help if you have someone else's support.</li>
                        <li>Tell your child that it's not unusual for young people to feel worried, stressed, or sad.
                            Also let them know that opening up about personal thoughts and feelings can be scary.</li>
                        <li>Tell your child that talking about an issue can often help put things into perspective and
                            make feelings clearer. Someone with more or different experience – such as an adult – may be
                            able to suggest options they haven't thought of.</li>
                        <li>Suggest some other people your child can talk to if they don't want to talk to you – for
                            example, an aunt or uncle, a close family friend, a sports coach or trusted religious
                            leader, an older person or a GP.</li>
                        <li>Tell your child that speaking to a GP or other health professional is confidential. These
                            professionals cannot tell anyone else, unless they are concerned about your child's safety
                            or the safety of others.</li>
                        <li>Emphasize that your child is not alone. You'll be there whenever they're ready to talk.</li>
                        <li>If you raise your concerns with your child, they may refuse any help or say nothing is
                            wrong. Many young people do not want to seek help themselves. So you may need to say that
                            you are worried about them and will try to get professional advice. It's best to encourage
                            children to come along.</li>
